# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- This application provides a daily message in the form of an affirmation or a pun to hopefully make you smile :) This application allows the user to choose which type of message they would like to recieve and the option to create their own. Some features of the app include:
  - Clicking the heart ❤️ icon next to a message to save it.
  - Viewing all saved messaged in the "View My Favorites" page located in the navigation bar.
  - Adding your own messages that can be saved as well.
  - Compatible viewing on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone.
  - Deleting messages from the "View My Favorites" page by clicking the red ❌ next to the message.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- We had about a week to work on the project.
- We are currently in week 3 at Turing.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- This was a solo project. 

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- From the Project Specs provided by Turing: 
  -Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  -Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
  -Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
  -Individualize your programming skill set
  
- My own individual goals for this project included:
  - Trying to implement features I've never done before, such as creating a like button, error messages, no repeat messages, and creating a single page application
  - Start learning about responsiveness designs and media queries
  

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- There were many challenges :) It helped to ask the question in different ways, or to take a step back from the project and write in a notebook what exactly I was trying to do. It also helped to console log anything and everything I was unsure about to see where in the code things were not working.
- I also want to get better at refactoring my code, and to make sure it is "dry".
- A win was learning about responsiveness design and getting features to actually work! yay!
